Let's say you have a number of small projects and applications you want to host on a single server, to keep the costs down. The applications may not be very load-heavy or barely used at all, but still want them public, then a single small server would suffice to run all applications on. Following this guide, you will set up one server with mutliple domains and subdomains, each running its own application.

## What we will get

## The server

## Domain name records

## Nginx configuration

## TLS with Let's Encrypt for HTTPS

## Scripts
