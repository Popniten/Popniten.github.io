#About me

![Pär 'Popniten' Eriksson](/assets/Popniten.jpg)

My name is Pär Eriksson and I am from Kalmar, Sweden. I am currently a student at Linnaeus University in Kalmar, attending
a program called **Utveckling och drift av mjukvarusystem** *(Software development and operations)*. This website is a part
of one of the courses, and most of what I do and learn at the university will be showcased here, as well as some other things.

Before I applied for the university, I had worked at an engineering industry as an assembler and CNC-machinist for 14 years. 
I liked it there but wanted to continue on my previous gymnasium (sort of high school) education, which was a natural 
science/IT program.

I have many interests, among them are astronomy, technology, animals, music, gaming (computer- and boardgames), drawing 
and many more. Too many interests to become good at any one maybe. But my main passion yet may be learning new things, 
especially in the world of computer science.
